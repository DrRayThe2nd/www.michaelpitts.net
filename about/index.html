			Michael studies at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta, Georgia. He plans to graduate with a Bachelor's of Computer Science in May 2025.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since 2012, Michael has been using computer code to automate various tasks or functions. This interest started in 2012 with the Python programming language. While Python is a simple language, Michael used it in early 2022 to create an automated numbers reporter for his Chick-fil-A location. This program compiles sales, speed, and labor costs for the day from Chick-fil-A's internal software into a simple report to read at a glance. In 2015, Michael learned the Java programming language to expand his knowledge base, and he has since learned a limited amount of Bash and HTML/CSS. Currently, he is learning Ruby on Rails, following which he plans to learn Rust. With over ten years of programming experience, Michael has equipped himself to succeed in any software development scenario.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the past eight years, Michael has used Debian, Ubuntu, and their various forks as his daily-driver operating system. Currently, he uses Zorin OS Pro 16.1 as his primary operating system. From his years of Linux experience, Michael is adept at partitioning, customizing, and repairing Linux installs. Recently, he modified the ACPI tables on his laptop's Zorin install to fix the lack of suspend-to-RAM created by its manufacturer. With that modification, Michael can suspend it for weeks instead of hours. He also has experience developing on cloud servers, including AWS and Linode. The former he uses to run the numbers reporter from the previous paragraph, and the latter runs this website. Michael's Linux experience makes him a great candidate for any software development or sysadmin position.
